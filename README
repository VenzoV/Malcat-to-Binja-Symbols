This repo contains two scripts to sync symbols between Malcat and Binary Ninja.
The scripts bridge the gap by converting Malcat’s File Offsets into the Virtual Addresses (VA) used by Binary Ninja.

Included Scripts
-Malcat_Symbols_Export.py Runs inside Malcat to extract identified functions. It applies a manual "delta" to rebase file offsets to memory addresses and saves them to a JSON file.
-Binja_Malcat_Symbols_Import.py A Python script for the Binary Ninja console. It imports the JSON data, defines user symbols, and forces Binary Ninja to create functions at the new addresses.


Instructions:
1. Run Malcat_Symbols_Export.py -> Outputs json file
2.Binja_Malcat_Symbols_Import.py  run in snippet editor with json file location.
